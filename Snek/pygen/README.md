# pygen

PyGen is a program that generates data to make interesting python programming questions.

# how to compile and run the project

1. make sure you have the [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) tool installed in your computer.

2. run `stack install` to compile and add the executable `pygen` to your path, make sure that you check where the executable is added by stack, I believe it differs between OS.

3. from the terminal run `pygen` with the first argument the topic, and the second argument the question type
optionally, run with `-h` flag to get help information
