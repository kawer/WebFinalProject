*** TODO Is the ~Gen a~ Quickcheck type needed, or is `Random a` enough?

*** TODO how do I take the value out of a `Gen a` ? i.e. how do you run a Gen

*** TODO IntDiv should have a lhs greater than rhs ?

*** TODO should we avoid div by zero? or put it as an exception ?

*** TODO Add possibility of adding "constraints" i.e., using the the `suchThat`
